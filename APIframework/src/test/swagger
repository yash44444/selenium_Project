swagger - is a way to define an API. The API deifnition describes :
	1) what requests are available
	2) what the response looks like for each request.
	3) all the things what you can do with an API
	4) Lets you design the API before implementing it.
	5) After swagger 2.0, the specification became open API specification ( OAS ).
	6) contains description of all the parameters which ones are mandatory and which ones are optional.
	7) schemas are defined for each of the parameters.
	8) sample request and responses are provided.
	
Request contain - Method, base url, path parameter, query parameter

Security - means authentication and authorization.
Can be: none, Basic Auth, API key, OAuth.

============================================================================================================
YAML - swagger uses structured data for API definition. we have 2 structured data formats - JSON or YAML.
YAML ain't markup language.Its not a markup language like html. Used for data not content.
Compared to json it minimises the characters.

"A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document.
 It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.
 XML is called the "Extensible Markup Language" since custom tags can be used to support a wide range of
 elements."
 
 Levels are indicated by white space identing. In xml we use open and close tags to indicate levels. This
 uses a lot of characters. In json we use brackets to indicate levels, less characters compared to xml.
 In yaml we use only indentation , no open close tags unlike xml, json.
 
 XML -   <name>
 			<firstname>Peter</firstname>
 			<lastname>parker</lastname>
 		 </name>
 		 
 JSON -  name: {
 			"firstname": "Peter"
 			"lastname": "parker"
 		 }
 		 
 YAML -  name:
 			firstname: Peter	
 			lastname: parker
 		
 YAML have lists just like json have arrays. a dash indicates it is a list for the yaml file.
 cart:
 	- name: joy
 	  age: 12
 	  color: black
