Map - Hashmap,LinkedHashMap,Treemap -------------->

hashmap - Insertion order not maintained,one null key and multiple null values allowed, fast, traversed by Iterator.
linkedhashpmap - insertion order maintained
treemap - maintain sorted order of keys, ascending order
hashtable - dsnt allow null, slow, traversed by Enumerator and Iterator.
HashMap<typeofkey typeofvalue>     HashMap<Integer, String>

Set - Hashset,Linkedhashset, treeset  -------------->
HashSet - insertion order not maintained, duplicate not allowed.
LinkedHashSet - insertion order maintained, duplicate not allowed.
TreeSet - maintain sorted order of set, duplicate not allowed.

Diff btw hashmap and hashtable ----------->  ?
hashmap is non synchronised, hashtable is synchronised i.e thread safe.
For each key there will be an object and for each object there will be a 32 bit hashcode assigned by jvm.

ArrayList -------------->
Resizeable array.
can have duplicate elements, maintain insertion order, Heterogeneous objects, non synchronized, slow.
null insertion possible.

when we go for LinkedList instead of ArrayList ?

Linkedlist ?
Arraylist is best when you want to retrieve elements. but if you wan to add or delete elements in the 
middle arraylist is the worst. But adding and removing in the middle at any index linkedlist is the best.
but retrieval operation is slowest in linkedlist since address of secn elements in carried by first element
and so on. so retrieval becomes slow.
- hetrogenous, null, duplicate, 

how elements are stored in hashtable ?
problem with linkedlist was retreival in sequecne order only.
element/size = location

what is array ?
Using array we can store more than 1 element into a variable.
In java since everything is object, the syntax of array becomes
syntax: 
type[] name;
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
int[] myNum = new int[size];

Set - Set is an interface which extends collection interface but implements hashset,treeset,linkedhastset.
does not allow duplicate, order not preserved, 

List - 
insertion order preserved
duplicates allowed

adding to list:  l.add();
